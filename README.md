- 👋 Hi, I’m @MalikGarza, I'm currently a Software Engineer for Paylocity. 
- 👀 I’m interested in creating meaningful change in the world with software engineering. I love problem solving and creating new connections with others. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to slow down. I have spent the first 24 years of my life racing to the next stage of my development.
      After a lot of self reflection I've learned it is better to solidify your skills rather than chasing new ones. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything and everything. I love connecting with people and learning how we all work. I really
      do believe that the best way to learn how someone thinks is to look at their code.
- 📫 How to reach me, my personal email is malikgarza@gmail.com.
